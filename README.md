# 🚀 iTerm Integration for VSCode

Open iTerm2 directly from VSCode's Explorer — because life's too short to `cd` around manually! 🎯

## ✨ Features

🗂️ **Open in iTerm** — Right-click any file or folder in the Explorer and launch iTerm right there

🏠 **Open Project Root in iTerm** — Jump straight to your workspace root with one click

🎹 **Command Palette Support** — Both commands available via `Cmd+Shift+P`, so you can bind your own keyboard shortcuts

## 📸 How to Use

### From the Explorer
Right-click any file or folder → pick your flavor:

- **Open in iTerm** — opens iTerm at that file/folder's directory
- **Open Project Root in iTerm** — opens iTerm at the workspace root

### From the Command Palette
`Cmd+Shift+P` → type `iTerm` → pick a command 🔍
